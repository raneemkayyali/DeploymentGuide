The following is the Relational Junction recommended set of permissions for the least amount of errors/access denials. This will cover 99% of NetSuite use cases; with coverage of all currently known accessible API objects.

If you are having issues with permission violations in your runs and you believe you have set your role up correctly, please contact [support](support@sesamesoftware.com) for assistance.

Note: If there is a permission in our list that is not available in your instance, it usually indicates that the feature tied to the permission is not used or has been disabled.
