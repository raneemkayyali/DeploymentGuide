### Obtain Data Center Code
1. Set this to the data center code which corresponds to your data center. Refer to the list [here](http://bullhorn.github.io/Data-Center-URLs/).
If you are uncertain about your data center code, codes like CLS2, CLS21, etc. are cluster IDs that are contained in a user's browser URL (address bar) once they are logged in.
Example: `https://cls21.bullhornstaffing.com/BullhornSTAFFING/MainFrame.jsp?#no-ba...` indicates that the logged in user is on CLS21.

### Obtain OAuth Information
* Unlike many other data sources, Bullhorn CRM doesn't allow users to create their own custom OAuth applications or edit their CallbackURL directly. Instead, the user must contact Bullhorn CRM and request that they create/change the user's OAuth information on Bullhorn CRM's end. The Bullhorn team will provide you with the OAuth credentials (ClientId and ClientSecret).
