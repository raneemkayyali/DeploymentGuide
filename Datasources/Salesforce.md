3. Datasource Information
   1. Username: *Salesforce Username*
   2. Password: *Salesforce Password*
   3. SFDC Token: *Salesforce API Token* (This can be omitted if you use whitelists in salesforce.)
4. If the Datasource is being used as a source:
      1. Query Date fields
         1. This is a comma separated list of fields that contain dates for use in incremental downloads.
         2. Choose any and all date fields in the Schema that are altered during a create or update of the records.
         3. The order of precedence is from left to right in what date field is chosen. Given a date field list `LastModifiedDate, CreatedDate` when the tables is queried it will check first if `LastModifiedDate` exists if it does, it will use that for incremental. If it doesn't then it will use `CreateDate`. If neither exist it will do a full table pull.
5. Click Test
6. Once you see Connection Test Successful, click Save and Close.
